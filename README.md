# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction

Predict student final grades using Machine Learning models based on lifestyle, study habits, and demographic data.

This project aims to help educators identify students at risk and intervene early by analyzing a variety of academic and social factors.

## ðŸ§  Models & Performance

| Model              | MAE  | RMSE | RÂ²   |
|-------------------|------|------|------|
| Linear Regression | 2.5  | 3.4  | 0.31 |
| Random Forest     | 1.8  | 2.7  | 0.64 |
| Gradient Boosting | 1.6  | 2.4  | 0.67 âœ… |

Gradient Boosting performed best and is used in the final application.
